# Materials Property Predictor

This calculator is published at http://ai.eecs.northwestern.edu/MPpredictor

## Installation Requirements

The basic requirement for using the files are a Python 3.6.8 environment with the packages listed in requirements.txt. It is advisable to create an virtual environment with the correct dependencies.

The work related experiments was performed on Linux Fedora 8.8 Ootpa. The code should be able to work on other Operating Systems as well but it has not been tested elsewhere.

## Source Files
  
Here is a brief description of the files and folders:

* `crossproperty.py`: code to launch the predictor.

* `functions.py`: code that contains functions to perform featurization.

* [`templates`](./templates): folder contains HTML files for the homepage and response page.

* [`static`](./static): folder contains the static elements (CSS, javascript files).

## Developer Team

The code was developed by Vishu Gupta from the <a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/">CUCIS</a> group at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northwestern University.
